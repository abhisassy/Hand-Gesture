# Hand-Gesture-Recognition 
Using Arduino Uno and Pyautogui to make laptop/PC  recognise hand gestures 
</br>
Materials Needed:</br>
> A laptop or Desktop </br>
> A webcam </br>
> Arduino Uno </br>
> 3 Ultra Sound Sensors </br>
> A light Sensor (lru) </br>
> An IR Sensor 

</br>
The </b>Dino Folder</b> contains a small snippet or example of how we use pyautogui and an Arduino Board and Ultrasonic Sensor to play the dino game on chrome.  

The Hand_gesture Folder coints the main .py and .ino file which implement the following functions:</br>
> Switch on/off Gestures </br>
> Switch between tabs </br>
> Auto-Brightness adjustment <br> 
> Vedio Playback functions : play,pause,rewind,forward, volume increse, volume decrease, enter fullscreen, exit (try these on Youtube)

You can implement different gesture recognition and map it to system functions.</br>
For different applications and scenarios edit the code and remap the different gestures to the specific functions required.
